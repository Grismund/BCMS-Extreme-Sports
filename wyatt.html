        <h2>The Sport</h2>
            <!--<img width=2src="https://www.northconwayrockclimbs.com/support-material/recluse.fa.jpg" alt="" />-->
            <p>It means you climb a rock formation without any other type of assistance or support besides your climbing harness. If you slip/fall, the only thing keeping you from tumbling down to the bottom is your safety rope and the clips anchored into the rock; better hope they’re secured!
</p>
            
        <h2>History</h2>
            <img width="300px"src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61J66R8S18L.jpg" alt="" />
            <p>Switzerland's Claude Remy provides a chronological analysis of the evolution free climbing (bouldering and difficulty). An article which clearly is not and cannot be definitive, but is merely a stimulus for further analysis and discussion about the evolution of this sport.

        <h2>Dangers</h2>
            <img width="300px"src="https://www.evorock.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/freeclimbingVSfreesoloing.jpg" alt="" />
            <p>Free solo climbing is a form of climbing where you don’t use ropes, harnesses, or any other protective equipment. It’s not the same as bouldering though where you’re at a safe height. This is the real deal, one of the most dangerous and extreme sports there is. It stands to reason that if you fall, you die.  How dangerous is free soloing? Let’s put it this way: no injuries are really reported in this extreme sport because those who don’t make it have died. So, in short, free soloing is an extremely dangerous sport, one that has led to the untimely deaths of many experienced climbers.

        <h2>Best of the Best</h2>
            <img width="300px"src="https://www.lasportiva.com/media/mageplaza/blog/auth/a/d/adam-ondrai-matteo-pavana2_1.jpg" alt="" />
            <p>Adam Ondra Ondra’s unique ability to save energy and manage his breathing – which includes shouting from the rock face during climbs – is what makes him extra special. His pulse rate goes down, not up, when he climbs.

        <h2>Stories</h2>
            <img src="" alt="" />
            <p>At 190cm tall, he’s a tower of a climber and his long neck acts as a balance tool. He doesn’t have as much arm strength as others, but his hip mobility allows him to put more weight on his legs and pull his centre of gravity closer to the face, saving power and helping him climb like a machine.

       <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <img src="" alt="" />
            <p>One of the most important insights into Alex Honnold’s nearly-decade-long obsession with climbing Yosemite’s El Capitan without a rope occurs deep in the film Free Solo. His girlfriend, Sanni McCandless, wants to know if Honnold feels a need to avoid death.
“Would putting me into the equation ever actually change anything?” she asks. “Would you actually make decisions differently?”
“If I had some kind of obligation to maximize my lifespan, then yeah, obviously I’d have to give up soloing,” the climber replies.
She presses the point. “Is me asking you - do you see that as an obligation?”
“No. No,” he bluntly replies. “But I appreciate your concerns,” Honnold continues, cracking a smile. “I respect that, but I in no way feel obligated, no.”
“ . . . to maximize life time.”
“No. No. But you saying, ‘Be safer,’ I’m kind of like, ‘Well, I’m already doing my best,’” says Honnold.“So I could just not do certain things, but then you have weird simmering resentment because the things you love most in life have now been squashed. Do you know what I mean?”
His girlfriend nods unconvincingly, looks away and blinks repeatedly, as if to hold back tears.
