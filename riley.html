            &lt;p&gt;Freerunning is a version of parkour that includes acrobatic moves that are purely aesthetic.
Parkour is the activity of activity or sport of moving rapidly through an area.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;“Writers on parkour trace its origins to the physical education and training methods developed beginning in the years before World war 1 by Georges Hebert and known as “la methode naturlle.” The regimen involved training in running, jumping, climbing, balancing swimming, and defending and use of the obstacle courses.” From https://www.britannica.com/sports/parkour&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;The dangers of freerunning parkour is that you can possible fall off a high building while trying to do a stunt.


Parkour can be risky if you are attempting to jump in between two buildings for example the guy in the background of this slide. 
Not many deaths are reported but im sure some die.
The famous Russian tracur Pavel Kashin fell down a 16 storeys to his death.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;“The #8 Parkour story of the decade is all about a profound change in the way Parkour was interpreted, practiced, and performed. The epitome of that change is what I am calling “The Rise of Flow.”
At the start of the 2010’s Parkour was pretty much like it had always been – jumping, running, climbing and short efficient lines. Of course freerunning was a part of the sport as it had virtually always been, and Traceurs flipped, spun, danced, and all the rest, but for the most part the discipline was unchanged in how it was approached and practiced.
David Belle’s famous “Et Vous” video was the epitome of Parkour pre-2010. Big jumps were king. This video has aged really well, unlike most of its contemporaries. 20 years later, some of these jumps still look huge which is a testament to how great the Belle was.
This video form the Vigroux Brothers was another one that stands out to me as the epitome of the times. As you can see, short lines and “big moves” (for the time these were big) were the focus. Warning: 240p awaits you.” From &lt;a href="https://parkour.com/the-8-parkour-story-of-the-decade-the-rise-of-flow/"&gt;Parkour.com.&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;In conclusion Freerunning parkour can be dangerous but people love doing it because it gives them pathion.
