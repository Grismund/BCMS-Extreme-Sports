   <h1>Bungee Jumping</h1>
   <h3>Written by Aunika B</h3>
   <h2>The Sport</h2>
   <img src="" alt="" />
   <p>“Bungee jumping is a recreational activity that involves jumping from a high surface while attached to an elastic cord. One end of this elastic cord is attached to the jumper’s body, while the other end is attached to a stationary object at the jumping point. Typically, this sport involves leaping from jumping points that are several hundred feet or meters high. The elastic cord used in this activity is designed to stretch during the jumper's fall and snap back up repeatedly. This causes the jumper to bounce up and down over the length of the jumping area until the energy from the jump has been depleted.”

   <h2>History</h2>

   <p>Bungee jumping has been predicted to be around since the mid-1980’s.
Origin: “Theory has it that what could be described as the first bungee jumps originated on Pentecost Island in the South Pacific thousands of years ago. The Naghol land diving ritual is the earliest recorded instance of an activity that could be compared to bungee jumping.”

   <p>There has been 23 deaths in the last 20 years from bungee jumping.
“Other health risks of bungee jumping vary in their severity. While such injuries as bruises and rope burn may be thought to be rather minor, dislocations and back injuries can range from moderate to disabling.”

   <p>When Katy Perry was on a world tour, she took time out to go bungee jumping in New Zealand. Right before her show, she jumped off the 142-foot Auckland Harbour Bridge.</p>

   <p>	As you can see there are many down sides along good sides to bungee jumping. Although there has been an increase in popularity over the years, I believe that bungee jumping is way too extreme. Even though many claim for it to be a fun activity, there are way more health concerns that are involved. It is not worth risking being paralyzed just from jumping off a high landmark. There are way too many variables that are involved that can cause an accident. Don’t bungee jump unless you are aware of the consequences.</p>
