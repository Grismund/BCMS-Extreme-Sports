    <h1>FREE SOLO CLIMBING</h1>
    <h3>By: Anna</h3>

    <h2>What is it?</h2>
    <p>“Free soloing is the easiest type of rock climbing to understand: No ropes are involved, and if you fall while climbing, you will fall all the way to the ground.”
        This is free soloing according to REI. You pretty much just climb up a mountain or some sort of structure (usually something in nature) without any equipment. No ropes, no nothing. You also do this alone. One way to think of it is that someone simply showed up to a cliff with some weird shoes and some chalk and just started scaling it! Alone!</p>

    <h2>Shoes</h2>

    <p>Climbers, especially professionals, have to wear a special type of shoe. Soooooo fashionable, right?</p>

    <h2>Let's take a look at some free soloers in action.</h2>

    <h2>Best of the Best</h2>

    <p>Alex Honnold is considered one of the best free solo climbers ever. He's in most of the images shown here. You can’t Google “free solo climbing” without seeing his name! Honnold has completed over 1000 climbs. You read that right. And, he says, he doen’t feel thatnervous whatsoever while climbing. One of the ways Honnold prepares himself for each climb is ascending the mountain multiple times with ropes. He memorizes precisely where he places his hands and feet, and then, when he’s ready, climbs it without any equipment or protection. Crazy, right?</p>

    <h2>An Amazing Story</h2>

    <p>Alex Honnold was the first person to free solo climb El Capitan, a rock face in Yosemite National Park in California. This is especially impressive because, according to an article, the route that Honnold climbed is 2900 feet. A movie was even made out of his climb. It is called Free Solo. According to the article ‘I can’t believe I j"ust did that’: Girl, 10, scales El Capitan, around 25 people ha"ve died on El Capitan, while more than 100 climbing-related accidents happen in Yosemite each year. Honnold said that he had been putting off soloing El Cap for years, but finally decided to do it in June of 2017. The New York Times described it as “one of the greatest athletic feats of any kind, ever.”

        <h2>History</h2>

        <p>According to the article, The History of Rock Climbing, John Muir free soloed Cathedral Peak in 1869 (and he did it wearing hiking boots! Impressive!). Then, in 1886, Walter Parry Haskett Smith (long name, I know) free soloed “Napes Needle,” a 70 foot high natural rock face. It was at this point that rock climbing became referred to as a sport. There were, of course, some more climbs in addition to these, but I’m hitting the significant ones! In 1935, Pierre Allain made the first ever soft-soled climbing shoe. In 2014, Alex Honnold free soloed El Sendero Luminoso in Mexico, and was the first person to do so. And, that now brings us to June of 2017, when Honnold free soloed El Capitan in a shocking 3 hours and 56 minutes.

        <h2>The Dangers of Free Solo Climbing</h2>
        <img src=https://www.framestore.com/sites/default/files/case-study/images/frame08_80_0.jpg " width=" 500px" height=alt="" />
        <p>The dangers of free solo climbing are extreme. List of 41 Extreme Sports says, “Anyone that does this is absolutely insane… In order to be a successful solo climber, you must have a “grip of death” and be able to 'hold on for dear life’, literally.” If you fall off of the structure that you’re climbing, you most likely won’t make it. Another danger of free soloing is not being able to find the right places to put your hands and feet. If you can’t find any footholds (or handholds?!), then you’re stuck! The dangers of free soloing are getting stuck, serious injury, or death.


            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>In conclusion, free solo climbing is, what I would consider, an extreme sport. The mental ability it would take to do such a thing is beyond me. I mean, to realize that if you were to put your foot in a slightly wrong position, you might die, and still continue to climb, is bizarre. And the extreme physical ability you would have to have to do this is outrageous. Anyways, that’s free solo climbing in a nutshell. Well, I guess maybe not a nutshell, but maybe a walnut or something. I don’t know.</p>
